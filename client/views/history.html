                  <h1>History</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The Dickson/Dixon (and other derivates) family name was first found in Scotland. Early records show Thomas Dicson, a follower of the Douglas clan, at the capture of Castle Douglas in 1307.</p>
                  <p>Although the name was Scottish in it's origin, with the spelling of Dicson or Dickson (the most common usage in Scotland today), being a Borders counties name it also spread to the north and midlands of England to become a popular family name with the spelling of Dixon.</p>
                  <p>It was during the 11th century that the use of surnames was introduced to the British Isles by the Normans. They were usually local (a place or landmark), patronymic ("son of"), a trade or profession name, or a nickname. The name Dixon/Dickson is a patronymic name, meaning "Dick's son" or "son of Dick". Coming from Scotland it might seem strange that it is not "MacDick", but this is simply explained again by it's Borders origins.</p>
                  <p>The ancient family motto is said to be "Fortes Fortuna Juvat", which is Latin for "Fortune Favors the Brave".</p>
                  <p>In his book, The Border and Riding Clans and a Shorter History of Clan Dixon, (published by Albany, New York, 1888) B. Homer Dixon wrote: - "In a charter from King Robert Bruce about A.D. 1306 to Thomas Dickson it [the name] occurs as Filius Ricardi (son of Richard) and the Charter is endorsed Carta Thomas fil Dick."</p>
                  <p>
                    <img src="/img/arms.gif" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-left">
                    "Nesbit in his Heraldry (Edinburgh, 1722) says 'The Dicksons are descended from one Richard Keith, said to be a son of the family of Keith's Earls Marshalls of Scotland.' and in proof thereof carry the chief of Keith Marischal. This Richard was commonly called Dick and the 'son' was styled after him. The affix of son in the Lowlands answering to the prefix Mac in the Highlands."
                  </p>
                  <p>Because of the connection to Richard Keith, the descendants of Thomas Dicson/Dickson are considered part of the Clan Keith and use their tartan.</p>
                  <p>The Chief of Clan Keith has the Latin motto "Veritas Vincit," which translates "Truth Conquers" which is also used on their clansman's badge.</p>
                  <p>In 1583, a list of Gentlemen and Surnames in the Marches of England and Scotland includes the name Dixon as Gentlemen of the East March. Many Dixons can also be found within the English East March, presumably having begun their association there when Berwick-Upon-Tweed was Scottish and it's Governor, the Keith Marischal.</p>
                  <p>Thomas Dickson himself has quite a history. He was associated in some way with William Wallace of "Braveheart", and he was killed by the English in 1307 in battle. Tradition states that he was slashed across the abdomen but continued to fight holding the abdominal wound closed with one hand until he finally dropped dead. He is buried in the churchyard of St. Bride of Douglas, and his marker shows him with a sword in one hand and holding his belly with the other.  Robert de Brus (Bruce) had made him Castellan of Castle Douglas the year before he was killed.</p>
                  <p>The Dixons (and other Borders Families) were formally recognized as a Clan by the Scottish Parliament in 1587  when the Parliament of Scotland passed a statute "For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subiectis inhabitantis of the bordors hielands and Ilis." Attached to the statute was a Roll of the Clans, and contained both a borders portion and a highland portion. The borders part of the Roll, shows the Dixons as a clan with chiefs in the East March.  According  to the book, Traits and Stories of the Scottish People, London, 1867, the Clan Dixon was known as 'The Famous Dicksons'!</p>
                  <p>Their daughters appear to have been likewise eminent, in their case we must suppose both for beauty and accomplishments, as the old rhyme says:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                     <p>
                       Boughtrip and Belchester<br>
                       Hatchetknows and Darnchester<br>
                       Leetholm and the Peel;<br>
                       If ye dinna get a wife in ane of thae places<br>
                       Ye'll ne'er do weel.
                     </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Buhtrig, Belchester, Leitholm and the Peel were Dickson baronies. Darchester belonged at one time to the Trotters.</p>
                  <p>In 1591, two bonds were signed by the principal Barons and Gentlemen of the East Marches pledging themselves to serve the King against Bothwell, and of the forty-one subscribers whose names have been preserved four were Dicksons.</p>
                  <p>In 1603, when the crowns of Scotland and England were united under James VI of Scotland, he found it expedient to disperse the unruly Border Clans to England, northern Scotland and to Ireland.</p>
                  <p>Border clans naturally differed quite widely from Highland clans, who after all had an active existence that lasted a century and a half longer than that of the border clans, giving them extra time for development. A main point of difference was the possession by the Highland clans of Gaelic speech and a unique culture of their own until 1745. The Highlanders were also geographically much more isolated from the general course of Scottish history than were the Scottish Borderers. Both Border and Highland clans, however, had the essential feature of chiefship, and had territories in which a majority of their clansmen lived.</p>
                  <p>Border clans did practice some Gaelic customs, such as tutorship when an heir who was a minor succeeded to the chiefship, and giving bonds of manrent. Although feudalism existed, tribal loyalty was much more important, and this is what distinguished the Borderers from other lowland Scots. In fact, the same is also true of the English Borderers.</p>

                  <h1>Heraldry</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The symbols and heraldry associated with our Scottish heritage are indeed fascinating to many people. Unfortunately, they are often misunderstood and misused. The Clan Keith Society USA, Inc. encourages all interested parties to learn and follow the rules of heraldry. Primarily, that there is no such thing as a family coat of arms. Arms are the property and signature of an individual, and the ownership of arms is strictly maintained by Lord Lyon. Those eager to show their support of Clan Keith are encouraged to use the clansman's crest badge as described below.</p>
                  <h2>Understanding Heraldry</h2>
                  <img src="/img/arms-small.jpg" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-left">
                  <p>"Heraldry, or armory, is a system of personal or corporate identification that first developed in Europe during the twelfth century and which is still in use today. It uses bright colors in recognizable and easily remembered arrangements together with objects, called 'charges'.... These colorful designs were first used on banners, shields and surcoats worn or carried by individual knights in battle and in tournaments. The term 'coat of arms' derives from the surcoat on which the heraldry was displayed.</p>
                  <p>In order that heraldic symbolism would be able to identify the individual, rules evolved whereby each coat of arms could belong to only one person at a time.... In some European countries, a system of 'patronymic arms' has grown up - persons bearing a particular name, although perhaps unrelated, are considered as having an equal right to the arms of the name. This is not the case in Scotland and it is essential in understanding Scots heraldry to realize that the rule concerning the individuality of heraldry was, and is, strictly applied under Acts of the Scottish Parliament of 1592 and 1672; even an eldest son may not bear his father's arms during his father's lifetime without a suitable difference being displayed. Consequently, the terms 'family arms' or 'clan crest' are meaningless in Scotland. Arms are strictly personal to the owner and their use or display by others, without permission, is illegal.</p>
                  <p>The only heraldic device which may be used by a non-armigerous clansman is the so-called strap and buckle or clansman's crest badge."</p>

                  <h2>Keith Heraldry</h2>
                  <img src="/img/arms.gif" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-left">
                  <p>According to early accounts, a warrior of the Chatti slew the Danish General Camus at the Battle of Barrie in 1010. For his valor, Malcolm II dipped three fingers into the blood of the slain and drew them down the shield of the warrior, thereafter named Marbhachair Chamuis, or 'Camus Slayer'. Ever since then, the chief of the Keiths has born on his arms the same three (sometimes four) red lines. This is depicted as early as 1316 on the seal of Sir Robert de Keith, marischal.</p>
                  <p>The Keith crest is a roebuck's head (usually a 10-point stag) emerging out of a Crest Coronet (notifying nobility).</p>
                  <p style="clear:both;"></p>
                  <h2>Keith Standard</h2>
                  <p>The standard is a long, narrow, tapering flag, granted by the Lord Lyon only to those who have a following, such as clan chiefs. As such, it is the property of that individual and should not be used or displayed by others except by permission (such as the educational purpose here).</p>
                  <p>At the hoist, the standard usually shows the owner's arms, though some are still granted with the former practice of having the national saltire in the hoist (as the one shown here). The remainder of the flag is divided into two tracts of the livery colors for chiefs of clans or families.... Upon this background are usually displayed the owner's crest and heraldic badges, separated by traverse bands bearing the owner's motto or slogan.</p>
                  <p>The length of the standard varies according to the rank of its owner, ranging from 4 to 8 yards. As the Earl of Kintore, the Chief of the Name Keith's standard is 6 yards in length.</p>

                  <h2>Keith Mottos</h2>
                  <p>Often associated with battle cries, mottos appear in virtually all Scottish Arms. Most authorities believe that mottos first appeared on standards and shields, and were thus used as war cries as well as religious or patriotic statements. They usually appear in an escrol above the individual's crest, as well as in the clansman's badge. Clan Keith recognizes two mottos:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Quae amissa salva, which translates What has been lost is safe. This motto references the role that the Keith family played in protecting the Scottish Regalia (crown, scepter, sword and scabbard) from Oliver Cromwell's troops during 1651-2.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Veritas vincit (Truth conquers)</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>Keith Plant Badge</h2>
                  <img src="/img/White_Rose.gif" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-left">
                  <p>The Keith plant badge is the <strong>white rose</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Before tartans and clan crests were established, plant badges were the likely symbols of clan affiliation. Many Scottish clans opted for sprigs from trees like oak, Scots pine, hazel, birch, juniper, rowan and even driftwood to identify themselves. Other clans chose among Scottish wildflowers for a plant badge.</p>
                  <p>Sprigs of the plant may be pinned behind the silver crest on their bonnet or sash-badge brooch. The plant badge may also be carried beside the Clan standard or fixed on a staff or spear.</p>
                  <h2>Keith Clansman's Crest Badge</h2>
                  <img src="/img/badge.gif" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-right">
                  <p>The clansman's crest badge may be worn and displayed by the Chief's relatives, including his own immediate family and even his eldest son, and ALL members of the extended family called the "Clan", whether bearing the Clan surname or that of one of its septs ; in sum, all those who profess allegiance to that Chief and wish to demonstrate their association with the Clan.</p>
                  <p>It is correct for these to wear their Chief's Crest encircled with a strap and buckle bearing their Chief's Motto or Slogan. The strap and buckle is the sign of the clansman, and he demonstrates his membership of his Chief's Clan by wearing his Chief's Crest within it.</p>

                  <h1>The Keith &amp; Austin Tartan</h1>
                  <img src="/img/piper.jpg" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-right">
                  <p class="initial-capital">There is no clearer symbol of Scottish identity than tartan, especially when worn in the form of a kilt. However, the origin and significance of the tartan in Scottish history is unclear.</p>
                  <p>Tartan is a particular weave of woolen cloth that is often associated with the modern use of the word plaid. Plaid patterns may include squares and rectangles woven in unique patterns, while tartan is made up only of squares.</p>
                  <p>Tartan is always woven as twill (two threads passing over two, then under two). A number of colored stripes of varying width are woven from the edge of the cloth, running its full length. The basic sequence of stripes (the sett) is then reversed around a number of pivot points so that the stripes continually repeat and reverse across the width of the cloth. The woven sequence is known as the warp. The same sequence of stripes, the weft, is then interwoven at right angles to the warp to create the finished tartan. It is the sett, therefore, that distinguishes one tartan from another.</p>

                  <h2>The Significance of Tartan</h2>
                  <p>The underlying significance of the tartan today is as a means of clan or family allegiance, but just when and how this became a part of Scottish culture is hotly debated. The Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland illustrates this confusion by sharing various perspectives on the matter:</p>
                  <blockquote><p>There are still some who would claim that, right back into the mists of time, each of the clans and families was immediately recognisable by the pattern or sett of the tartan that wore it. The idea is attractively romantic, but the evidence for it is extremely slight and it rests on one or two isolated and far from conclusive examples. While there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Highlanders wore tartan, there is very little which fits with the idea that a widespread system of recognition existed before the early 1800s (928).</p></blockquote>
                  <p>One factor that has been decisive about the history of the development of the modern system of identification has been the influence of the tartan manufacturer. They were responsible for developing early catalogs and order books. It was soon accepted that the authority for stating what was the correct tartan for a clan must be its chief. In 1815, the Highland Society of London began its collection of approved tartans; and the first book on clan tartans appeared in 1831.</p>
                  <p>Identifiable tartans have grown, as the Scottish Clan and Family Encyclopedia states, "from a trickle to a flood. Many clans have more than one tartan; there are a host of names who are distinguished by a tartan of their own although they have never constituted a clan; and against a list of around one hundred recognized clan chiefs today, records of some two thousand named tartans exist, of which a number represent public bodies or commemorate specific events (39)."</p>
                  <h2>Different Types of Tartan</h2>
                  <p>In addition to normal clan tartan, in some cases a clan may also have 'Hunting' or 'Dress' setts adapted for their particular activity (hunting more muted and dress more fancy).</p>
                  <p>Other tartans may be described as "Ancient", "Modern", "Reproduction", "Weathered" and "Muted". The first three of these have nothing to do with the antiquity of the pattern, but with the dyes employed.</p>
                  <h2>The Keith and Austin Tartans</h2>
                  <p>The proper name for Clan Keith's tartan is "Keith and Austin". While Austins were a sept of Clan Keith, it is unclear as to how their surname became a part of the official tartan name. Either way, the Chief of Clan Keith recognizes both an Ancient and Modern version of the sett (shown below). Today's Clan Keith members may wear either, but the ancient is much more common - in part because the darker dyes used with the modern tartan make it difficult to distinguish from the famous Black Watch tartan.</p>

                  <h1>Highland Dress</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The evolution of Highland dress owes much to the military. After the Proscription, civilian dress began to reflect that of the military. Many of the characteristic features of today's dress have a military origin, such as the shoulder straps on today's jackets and the buttons on the sleeve.</p>
                  <p class="clearfix">
                    <img src="/img/coat.jpg" alt="" class="pull-left margin-right-10 img-thumbnail">
                    The cuts of various forms of evening jacket can also be traced back to the late 1700s, including the "Prince Charlie" (shown left) and Argyle.
                  </p>
                  <p>Toward the end of the eighteenth century, the great kilt gave way to today's "little kilt". Early kilts were usually made of less material, for economic reasons, and were worn much higher up the leg. Today, it is considered proper for the kilt to fall to the top of the wearer's knee (although many wear it improperly longer).</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Sporrans</strong> started out as utilitarian leather pouches hung about the waist and drawn together with strings. The more decorative 'sporan molach', or hair sporran, appeared toward the end of the eighteenth century. Today sporran's are primarily decorative, with more casual leather available for day-wear and more formal hair sporrans for evening-wear.

                    <strong>Hose</strong> were originally made of cloth, and usually patterned with a red and white 'war pattern'. They were later replace by knitted woollen hose. Today's white hose are of modern origin, originating in the 1960s as a substitute to the diced or tartan hose for evening wear.

                    <strong>Dirks</strong> were originally worn as personal weapons. Today they are worn in great variety, both day and night, but 'proper' wear is 'for evening full-dress occasions'. The 'sgian dubh', worn in the hosetop, became general wear only in the nineteenth century.

                    The round knitted <strong>bonnet</strong>, originally worn flat, towards the end of the eighteenth century was cocked up vertically and then decorated by ostrich plumes. This eventually became the military feather bonnet, and by creasing the unadorned bonnet from front-to-rear, became the Glengarry bonnet (shown left). Bonnets as a part of Highland dress are also worn less frequently today.

                    <p>Although the story by which the tartan kilt has become the national dress of Scotland is tortuous and myth-laden, and the way in which it is worn can vary from the sublime to the ridiculous, Highland dress is a powerful symbol of the wearer's pride in a Scottish ancestry and in Scotland itself. There are few, if any, other forms of national dress which can claim to make such a clear and unequivocal statement, and to be so instantly and widely recognisable (42).</p>

                  <h2>Dressing for the Occasion</h2>
                  <p>Many members of Clan Keith choose to show their Scottish and clan pride by wearing the tartan and/or Highland dress. This dress is not required and can be quite expensive, but should you choose to become actively involved in Scottish and clan events you will probably choose to follow this practice. Our society is dedicated to observing and respecting our heritage, and thus we encourage individuals to properly wear the tartan and/or Highland dress. One of the best instructional guides is <i>So You're Going to Wear the Kilt? by J. Charles Thompson</i> (published by Heraldic Art, Arlington, VA).</p>

                  <h3>Women</h3>
                  <p>The guidelines for women's attire are much less defined than those of men. Two popular options are wearing a tartan sash and clansman's badge with normal attire (whatever the occasion), and kilted skirts in the clan tartan. Keith t-shirts and golf shirts are also available for more casual occasions.</p>
                  <p>Special guidelines to keep in mind according to <i>So You're Going to Wear the Kilt?</i> by J. Charles Thompson:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Women wearing the sash should pin it to their right shoulder. There are only three exceptions where pinning the sash on the left shoulder is appropriate;</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>ladies who are chiefs</li>
                      <li>ladies who are married to a chief</li>
                      <li>ladies who are married to colonels of Highland regiments</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>"No lady is going to wear the kilt". Female dancers and pipe band members, however, do wear kilts. Thompson's point is that the kilt is not anatomically designed for women, and women should therefore wear skirts, kilted or other.</p>

                  <h1>Origins of Clan Keith</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The Keiths traced their origins back to an ancient Rhineland tribe called the Catti. Sometime in the first century BC, so the legend goes, the Catti fought the Romans in the Hercynian forest: their retreat took them by Katwyck on the Rhine to embark for Scotland from the coast of Holland. Just how many Catti took to the boats in the exodus is not known but they eventually made landfall in Caithness or -a as it was perhaps more recognizably known in first-century Scotland - Cattiness.</p>
                  <p>From the time they landed the Catti began to multiply significantly and adopted the local ways by joining the clan system as Clan Chattan. The clan spread throughout the north of Scotland and , as with all success stories of their time, what the Catti couldn't win with the sword they won by marriage. Most of all they seemed to have had a sixth sense when it came to making a decision about which side to support in the wars and power struggles of the coming centuries. By this time the family name had changed to Keth or Keith.</p>

                    </figure>
                    History tells us that the first Keith to draw a sword for his sovereign and profit by it was Robert Keith: he slew Cammus, a Danish invader, in single combat at the Battle of Barras in Angus in 1010. Rewards quickly followed with the grant of lands in East Lothian and Robert's appointment as hereditary Grand Marischal of Scotland. With his title came a motto <strong>VERITAS VINCIT</strong> or 'truth conquers' and a coat of arms. Concerning the origins of the heraldic device, the story goes that when the Battle of Barras was over, the King (Malcolm II) came to look at the dead body of Cammus the Dance and, pleased with what he saw, bent down and dipped his fingers in the Dane's still-warm blood to make three strokes, or pales, on Keith's shield. Yet another version tells that a noble combatant disputed the Keith claim of having killed Cammus and was then himself challenged to single combat over this point of honour. This dispute was resolved when Keith killed the nobleman and it was this noble's blood which decorated Keiths shield - this is perhaps a better and more satisfying explanation of the motto and coat of arms. Robert Keith went on to marry Margaret Fraser of Tweeddale and founded the Keith family. - <i>from Sam Coull's Nothing But My Sword, p. 7-8.</i>
                  </p>
                  <p>These early accounts, however, remain disputed by some as "absurd fictions" (see <i>Clan Keith</i> by Alan McNie, 1986; <i>The Great Historic Families of Scotland</i> by James Taylor, 1887). "All that is known with certainty on the subject is, that in the reign of David I, when Norman, Saxon, Flemish and Scandinavian settlers in great numbers took up their residence in Scotland, a part of the district of Keith, in East Lothian, was possessed by a baron named Herveius, who witnessed the charter by which King David granted Annandale to Robert de Brus. His estate received from him the designation of Keith Hervei, and afterwards of Keith Marischal." - <i>Clan Keith</i> by Alan McNie, 1986</p>
                  <p>His son, Herveius de Keith, held the office of King's Marischal under Malcolm IV and William I. The family soon became numerous and powerful, and spread their branches far and wide throughout the Lowland districts of Scotland.</p>

They had a number of children, including Alexander who later received estates at Pittendrum (1513). The 3rd Earl supported King James III against barons, and had custody of the young James V in the 1520s; both of which awarded him with lands and honors. Both of his sons were killed at Battle of Flodden Field (where the dead included Sir William Keith of Inverugie and Sir John Keith of Ludquhairn). His son Robert sired two grandsons for the 3rd Earl, William and Robert Abbot of Deer.

He hid the Keith Banderole around his person so that it wouldn't be found. The Skirving family presented this historic relic to the Advocates Library in Edinburgh in the 19th Century. The Banderole is six foot in length with three stags and the motto "Veritas Vincit".

                              <strong>4th (3rd) Earl Marischal</strong> William (1501-1581)

                                William, 4th Earl Marishal was one of the guardians of Mary Queen of Scots during her minority, and was a member of her privy council on her return to Scotland. While refraining from extreme partisanship, he was an adherent of the Reformation.
                              </p>
                              <p>His contributions to the Keith fortunes came from his marriage to Margaret, daughter and heiress of Sir William Keith of Inverugie. This marriage nearly doubled the family lands, reaching into seven shires: Haddington, Linlithgow, Kincardine, Aberdeen, Banff, Elgin and Caithness. His estates lay in so many counties that he could travel from Berwick to John o' Groats eating every meal and sleeping every night on his own lands.</p>

                                The Earl was reputed to be the wealthiest man in Scotland at one time, but his extravagant lifestyle began to diminish the family's estate. Upon this realization, William retired to a private life at Dunnottar Castle in 1567. This self-imposed incarceration lasted for over seventeen years, until all the debts were cleared, and earned him the moniker "William of the Tower".
                              </p>
                              <p>William died in 1581 and was succeeded by his grandson.</p>

                                "The founder of Aberdeen's second university (Marischal College) was educated at its first (King's College) and then in Calvinist Geneva. After succeeding his grandfather as Earl Marischal (1581) he stood by James VI after the Ruthven Raid and in 1585 was involved in the defense of Stirling Castle against those nobles sympathetic to the Raiders and lately returned from exile. In 1589 he was chosen as the royal emissary to arrange the marriage with Anne of Denmark and to fetch the bride. Bad weather, for which Keith was subsequently exonerated, forced the returning party to seek shelter in Norway. The impatient James sailed from Scotland to meet his bride and the wedding took place in Oslo. Keith was subsequently a privy councilor and much concerned in the congenial (for a strict Calvinist) task of hunting down and prosecuting his northern rival, the Catholic Earl of Huntly. The Reformation may also have triggered his foundation of Marischal College in 1593. In 1609 he became High Commissioner or Viceroy to the Parliament of Scotland. The Earl was married twice, producing two children from the first and one from the second. He died at Dunnottar in 1623."

                                Son of the 5th Earl, William Keith became the 6th Earl Marischal. He officiated at the coronation of Charles I, and served in his Privy Council.

                                The son of the 6th Earl Marischal, William Keith signed the National Covenant for Religious Freedom and joined the army of James Graham, First Marquis of Montrose, in 1639. Six years later, however, Montrose switched to supporting the Royalist Army due to the mounting threat of Oliver Cromwell. This put Montrose at odds with the 7th Earl, who chose to decline Montrose's offers of negotiation and refused him entrance to Dunnottar to discuss terms. In retaliation, the Captain's envoy set fire to every house, barn, stable and even ship in the baronies of Dunnottar, Fetteresso and Cowie.
                              </p>
                              <p>In July 1650, the young King Charles II arrived in north-east Scotland and stayed a while at Dunnottar. Outraged by the king's return to Scotland, Oliver Cromwell, the self-proclaimed Lord Protector, led an invasion to the north. In some haste Charles II was crowned at Scone, but the crown and other regalia were then hidden at Dunnottar by order of the King. Shortly thereafter, the Earl Marischal and a number of other Scottish noblemen were captured by a troop of Cromwell's forces.</p>
                              <p>While imprisoned in the Tower of London (he was held there for ten years), the Earl named George Ogilvy of Barras to serve as Governor of Dunnottar Castle (1651-2). Shortly thereafter the castle was under siege from Cromwell's army, and by May 1652, it remained the only place in Scotland that still flew the royal flag. Under heavy artillery bombardment that resulted in the partial destruction of the castle, and with no hope for reinforcements from royalists, Ogilvy surrendered after 8 months. Before the surrender, however, the Scottish regalia were smuggled away from the castle and hidden at nearby Kinneff Church.</p>
                              <p class="clearfix">
                                <img src="/img/scot-regaliaTN.jpg" alt="Scot Regalia" class="img-thumbnail pull-left margin-right-10">
                                The Honours remained in the custody of Mr Grainger at Kinneff until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. At the opening of the Scottish Parliament the following year, the Earl Marischal carried the crown, his brother, George (later the 8th Earl) the scepter, and the younger brother John (later the first Earl of Kintore) the sword.
                              </p>
                              <p>The 7th Earl thus upheld the traditions of the Marischalcy but his finances had suffered severely, partly through his own extravagance, but mainly due to the continuous troubles. He spent most of the rest of his life in London where he could more easily hide his poverty.</p>
                              <p>He was married twice, which produced three daughters from the first marriage but no children from the second. He was, therefore, succeeded by his brother George in 1661.</p>

                              <p>Brother to the previous Earl, George Keith supported his brother and Charles II during the Restoration. His involvement with the protection of the Scottish Regalia is noted above. At the time of his brother's death, much of the families wealth had diminished. Dunnottar Castle, once the pride of the Keiths, had been badly damaged by Cromwell's forces: the Keep was vulnerable to the elements and the stately halls had been rifled of their contents. The Earl Marischal did not have the means to repair the damage, so Dunnottar served as a military depot. In the summer of 1685 it served as a prison to 122 men and 45 women Covenanters (resulting from Charles II's rejection of religious freedom in favor of the Episcopacy).</p>
                              <p>The 8th Earl served as a Colonel in France, and he married Mary Hay, daughter of the Earl of Kinoul. They had only one son, who became the 9th Earl upon George's death in 1694.</p>

                                During the spring of 1689, Dunnottar housed a garrison of sixty men under the leadership of William Keith, 9th Earl Marischal. Holding the castle for the monarchs William and Mary, the Earl oversaw the imprisonment of seventeen Aberdonians accused of being Jacobites. Among the captives was George Liddel, one of his own appointees at Marischal College. As a staunch Jacobite sympathizer himself, it is safe to say that these prisoners were treated far better than the Covenanters that were held there a few years before. They were released one year later upon an Act of Indemnity by order of the Privy Council.
                              </p>
                              <p>The 9th Earl sat as a peer in Parliament at Westminster. He was a Jacobite sympathizer, as already noted, and opposed the union of Scotland and England.</p>
                              <p>He is noted for completing much of the construction of Inverugie Castle, which became the Keiths' principal home. He married Mary, daughter of James Drummond, Earl of Perth. They had two sons and two daughters. During a time of religious unrest, it is important to note that religion was never an obstacle for the Keiths' political endeavors: "Here we have [William Keith], an Episcopalian, his [wife] a Catholic and [son James] a Protestant, all of them desperate to have a Catholic Stuart King on the throne (Coull, 28)." William died in 1712.</p>

In 1715, for having supported the cause of the Stuart kings, the English revoked his titles and estates. Exiled to Europe, George and his brother James achieved fame and esteem among the courts of Spain, France, Russia and Germany. Representing Frederick the Great of Germany, he returned on a visit to England, was reprieved for supporting the Stuarts, and had some of his family properties restored to him.... including Dunnotar castle . The painting at right shows the Earl in his younger years. George died, childless, in 1778, and chiefship of Clan Keith then passed to the Earl of Kintore."

                  <h1>Clan Feuds</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The association of clans with disorder is in part due to their turbulent origins. A number of races converged on Scotland, leading to conflicts over cultural and ethnic differences. For instance, the MacLeods derive from Norsemen; the Murrays and Sutherlands from Flemish stock; the Bruces and Frasers from Normans and Angevins; the royal Stuarts from a Breton nobleman; Clan Chattan from Celts. As Scottish culture developed into greater hegemony, many of these feuds subsided.</p>
                  <p>Feuds often developed between neighboring clans in the form of territorial disputes. Religion, politics, and even unrequited love have all contributed to feuding.</p>
                  <p>Two clans that the Keiths often found themselves in contention with were the Gunns and the Irvines.</p>
                  <h2>Clan Gunn</h2>
                  <img src="/img/gunn-2003-2.jpg" alt="Clan Gunn" class="img-thumbnail margin-right-10 pull-left">
                  <p>In the fourteenth century by a marriage with the heiress of the Cheynes of Ackergill, the Keiths took possession of lands in Caithness, and for a long time their settlement there was a source of feuds with the Clan Gunn.</p>
                  <p>The following account, entitled "The Crowner Slain by the Keiths in the Chapel of St. Tayre", comes from a 1764 text:</p>
                  <div class="clearfix"></div>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>About the year of God 1478, there was some dissention in Caithness betwixt the Keiths and the Clan Gunn. A meeting was appointed for their reconciliation, at the Chapel of St. Tayre, in Caithness, hard by Girnigo, with twelve horse on either side. The Crowner (chieftain of Clan Gunn) with the most part of his sons and chief kinsmen came to the chapel, to the number of twelve; and, as they were within the chapel at their prayers, the Laird of Inverugie and Ackergill arrived there with twelve horse, and two men upon every horse; thinking it no breach of trust to come with twenty-four men, seeing they had but twelve horses as was appointed.</p>
                    <p>So the twenty-four gentlemen rushed in at the door of the chapel, and invaded the Crowner and his company unawares; who, nevertheless, made great resistance. In the end the Clan Gunn were all slain, with the most of the Keiths. Their blood may be seen to this day [1764] upon the walls within the Chapel at St. Tyre, where they were slain. Afterwards William Mackames (the Crowner's grandchild) in revenge of his grandfather, killed George Keith of Ackergill and his son, with ten of their men, at Drummuie in Sutherland, as they were travelling from Inverugie into Caithness.</p>

                  <h2>Clan Irvine</h2>
                  <p>Both families originated in the North-east and got their lands from King Robert the Bruce. He granted both the Irvines and the Keiths land and hereditary honours for their loyalty during the Wars of Independence, such as in the years which followed the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Sir William Keith owned land around Kintore and Inverurie but added estates in Kincardine, on the south bank of the River Dee, through marriage. This brought the Keiths and the Irvines, who owned the land on the north bank of the Dee, face to face, After a time there was prolonged skirmishing across the Dee and this culminated in a battle at Keith's Muir on the north side of the river at Drumoak. None of the invading Keiths was left to tell the tale. The feud was eventually settled and the families reconciled by marriage.</p>

Keith returned to England where, in 1700, he was ordained a priest in the Anglican Church. He was again in America (1702-4), preaching and baptizing.

The latter deals mainly with the reign of Queen Mary and, though in narrative form, was the product of extensive archival research.

                                Scottish field marshal of Prussia; brother of George Keith, 10th earl marischal [marshal] of Scotland. He participated in the Jacobite uprising of 1715 and in the abortive invasion of 1719 with his brother. Escaping to the Continent, he first entered the Spanish service and then went to Russia, where he gained honor in both civil and military offices. Later he went to Prussia and became close friends with Frederick the Great, who made him a field marshal (1747). Keith entered the circle of Europe's leading intellectuals and rendered great service to Prussia in the early part of the Seven Years War. He was killed in the Battle of Hochkirch.

                                Marshall's career was in the household of the Duke of Gordon, to whom he eventually became factor. He was never a professional musician and often laid his violin aside for months on end, but his contribution to Scottish fiddle music was a major one. He extended the variety of keys, as well fro regular use of higher positions for the left hand. In this he shows the beginning of the absorption of Continental violin technique as well as style into the mainstream of the traditional where, previously, it had been concentrated in the hands of professional orchestral violinists/composers. He was a master of the Strathspey but also composed a number of classical-style minuets dedicated for the most part to leading Tories. His best-known melody is his setting of Burns' 'Of a' the airts the wing can blaw'. Marshall was also an exceptionally talented horologist.

                                The eldest of 15 children, John Marshall was born in Germantown (now Midland), Virginia. His father rose to prominence in local and state politics, and his grandfather was a Scottish minister. Proud of his Scottish heritage, it has been said that he wore a Keith clan ring throughout his professional life.
                              </p>
                              <p>A member of the Culpepper Minutemen early in the American Revolutionary War, he entered the Third Virginia Continental Regiment on 30 July 1776 and served ably in a number of important campaigns, rising to Captain. He became a lawyer after the war, serving his state as a leader in the Assembly and in the new Federalist Party. He attracted attention from national leaders, and was offered several diplomatic posts, but preferred to remain in Virginia. In 1797, however, he accepted an appointment on a three-man commission to negotiate with France. After French leaders demanded personal bribes (see XYZ Affair) in return for engaging in the negotiations, Marshall answered for his colleagues in a brilliant memorial which rejected this extortion and upheld the honor and dignity of the new country.</p>
                              <p>Later, Marshall was asked by John Adams to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, but instead Marshall opted to run for a position in Congress. Elected in 1799, Marshall became Secretary of State on 6 June 1800. Here he strongly opposed violations of American rights on the high seas and adopted a policy which necessitated a strong Navy to give force to American diplomatic protests.</p>
                              <p>Appointed Chief Justice on 20 January 1801, Marshall continued to serve as Secretary of State until the end of Adams' administration 4 March 1801. In the United States Supreme Court, Marshall made his greatest contributions to the development of American government. In a series of historic decisions, he established the judiciary as an independent and influential branch of the government equal to Congress and the Presidency. Perhaps the most significant of these cases was that of Marbury v. Madison, in which the principle of judicial review was simply stated by Marshall: "A legislative act contrary to the Constitution is not law." Then, as the young nation was endangered by regional and local interests which often threatened to tear it to shreds, Marshall again and again interpreted the Constitution broadly so that the Federal Government had the power to become a respected and creative force guiding and encouraging the nation's growth. For practical purposes, the Constitution in its most important aspects today is the Constitution as John Marshall interpreted it. As Chief Justice he embodied the majesty of the Judicial Branch of the government as fully as the President stood for the power of the Executive Branch. Marshall served as Chief Justice through five presidential administrations, a stalwart proponent of Federalism and nemesis of the Jeffersonian school of government throughout its heyday. He died July 6, 1835, having served as Chief Justice for nearly 35 years.</p>

In 1798 he founded Potosi, Missouri and became a miner and trader there. Hard times caused him to go to Texas in 1820 and get the Spanish governor's permission to settle 300 families in Texas. The grant was confirmed in 1821, but Moses Austin died without realizing his settlement plans. His son, Stephen F. Austin, took up the plans.

                                He served (1826-32) as professor of jurisprudence at the Univ. of London, and his lectures were published (with additional material) as The Province of Jurisprudence Determined (1832, repr. 1967, 3 vol.) and Lectures on Jurisprudence (1869, 5th ed. 1911). These books presented a comprehensive analysis of the principles underlying all legal systems. Austin argued that law was the expression of the will of the sovereign authority and was not to be confused with the dictates of religion and ethics. Austin's work—in part stemming from that of Jeremy Bentham —had a strong influence on many later legal theorists, including John Stuart Mill . His wife, Sarah Taylor Austin, was a well-known translator.

He grew up in Missouri, studied at Transylvania Univ. in Kentucky, served (1814-20) in the Missouri territorial legislature, and was studying law in New Orleans when his father died. Stephen took up the plans to colonize Texas and on a journey there (1821) selected the area between the Brazos and Colorado rivers. In Jan., 1822, he planted the first legal settlement of Anglo-Americans in Texas. He later went to Mexico City to have his grant cleared and confirmed by the newly independent Mexican government. Austin's settlements, with the towns of San Felipe de Austin and Brazoria, prospered. Other American colonists poured in. As friction developed over the years with the Mexican government, Austin opposed illegal efforts at Texan independence. He was sent in 1833 to Mexico City to present the settlers' grievances, to ask that Texas be separated from Coahuila, and to get the Mexican immigration law modified. He was accused of treason and imprisoned. On his return to Texas in 1835 he opposed the government of Santa Anna and so forwarded the Texas Revolution. He was sent as one of the commissioners (1835-36) of the provisional government to obtain aid in the United States, was defeated (1836) by Samuel Houston for the presidency of Texas, and served briefly until his death as secretary of state.

                                Born in Falkirk, Caithness-shire, Scotland. When he was 17, his father sent him to an uncle in northern England to learn the brewing business. Five years later, when Keith migrated to Halifax, Nova Scotia, he became sole brewer and business manager for Charles Boggs, and he bought out Boggs’ brewery in 1820. On 17 Dec. 1822 he married Sarah Ann Stalcup, who died in 1832. On 30 Sept. 1833 he married Eliza Keith; they had six daughters and two sons. One son, Donald G. Keith, became a partner in the brewing firm in 1853.

                                In 1822 Keith moved his brewery and premises to larger facilities on Lower Water Street and in 1836 he again expanded, building a new brewery on Hollis Street. In 1863 he began construction of Keith Hall which was connected by a tunnel to his brewery. Keith Hall, now occupied by Oland’s Brewery, is in the Renaissance palazzo style, with baroque adornments, pillars of no particular style, and a mansard roof. This peculiar combination of styles resulted from the fact that the designs were probably derived from books with plans of buildings in Great Britain and the United States.

                              <p>Keith became commissioner of the court of common pleas, served as mayor of Halifax in 1843, 1853, and 1854, and was also for a long period a director of the Bank of Nova Scotia. He became a member of the legislative council in 1843, sat in that body for thirty years, and when the Nova Scotian legislature was constituted in 1867 became president of the upper house. In the same year he was appointed to the Dominion senate, but declined the office.</p>
                              <p>At the time of his death in 1873, his estate was evaluated at $251,000. Throughout his career Keith was connected with several charitable and fraternal societies. He served as president of the North British Society from 1831 and as chief of the Highland Society from 1868 until his death. In 1838 he was connected with the Halifax Mechanics Library and in the early 1840s with the Nova Scotia Auxiliary Colonial Society. Keith was perhaps best known to the Halifax public as a leader of the freemasons. He became provincial grand master for the Maritimes under the English authority in 1840 and under the Scottish lodge in 1845. Following a reorganization of the various divisions in 1869, he became grand master of Nova Scotia.</p>

He spent some time assisting Dr Wallich with his Indian herbarium before being sent to Landour in the Himalayas to take charge of the sanatorium. In 1831 he became Superintendent of the Saharapre Botanic Garden where he pursued both botanical and palaeontological research. He is especially known for his discovery of fossil mammals in the Siwalik Hills and for the early cultivation of tea in this area. In 1848 he succeeded Dr Wallich as head of the Calcutta Botanic Garden where he introduced chinchona (quinine) and recommended commercial cultivation (it later became an important economic crop). In 1855 he left India to continue his fossil studies in Britain. He died in London.

Migrating to California for his health, he arrived at Sutter's Fort (site of present Sacramento) in 1845 and soon acquired land and livestock. After fighting in the Mexican War, he returned in 1847 to find his livestock gone. Having sold his land, he undertook to build a sawmill for John A. Sutter . In Jan., 1848, while supervising the digging of the mill race, Marshall discovered gold. This discovery launched the famous gold rush of 1849. The claims of Marshall and Sutter were ignored, the sawmill failed, and Marshall ended his days, embittered and misanthropic, working as a gardener.

                                William Keith was the leading artist in San Francisco and perhaps California's most highly regarded painter at the end of the nineteenth century. A longtime friend of fellow Scot and California naturalist John Muir, the pair were instrumental in the foundation of the U.S. National Parks System and the Sierra Club.

He moved to San Francisco in 1860 and later turned to painting, studying in Düsseldorf in 1870 and in Munich in the 1880s. His Western landscapes evolved from early mountain epics to later intimate natural scenes. The Keith Memorial Gallery of the Oakland Art Museum is devoted entirely to his work, and another extensive collection is owned by Saint Mary's College of California.</p>

                              <strong>Minor Cooper Keith</strong> (1848-1929), American magnate and founder of the United Fruit Company

                                Born in Brooklyn, NY, Minor Cooper Keith arrived in Costa Rica in 1873, joining his three brothers who had a contract with the government to build a railroad between Puerto Limon and San José. The 103 mile railroad would cut through the swampy lowlands of the Caribbean coast and over the central plateau.
                              </p>
                              <p>What did not at first seem to be a difficult project took 19 years to build and only succeeded because of Keith's perseverance. Four thousand workers, including Keith's brothers, died constructing just 25 miles of tracks. Disease, heavy rains and a lack of labor slowed down the process.</p>
                              <p>Costa Rica defaulted on the promised loans, and granted Keith ownership of the tracks and 80,000 acres of adjacent land for the renegotiation of loans with British bankers.</p>
                              <p>Keith turned to cultivating bananas on the land given to him by the Costa Rica and gave the fruit an important place in Costa Rican history. He established the first steamship service to bring these bananas to the United States. He gained control of other plantations in Panama and Colombia and dominated the banana trade. In 1899 he combined his plantation interests with those of the Boston Fruit Company in the West Indies to form the United Fruit Company. The company controlled 75 percent of banana sales in the United States.</p>
                              <p>110 thousand bunches of bananas were exported in 1883. Seven years later, exports reached 1.035 million. 1900 saw the number rise to 3.4 million, and 1907 more than ten million.</p>
                              <p>He returned to railroad building, organized (1912) the International Railways of Central America, and completed an 800-mile railway system, but died before realizing his dream of a line from Guatemala to the Panama Canal. His work profoundly altered the economic life of Central American countries.</p>

He first distinguished himself as a staff officer in World War I and later (1919-24) was aide to General Pershing . After varied tasks, including service in China (1924-27), he headed (1939-45) the army as Chief of Staff, becoming General of the Army (five-star general) in Dec., 1944. In this capacity, he reorganized and mobilized the military during World War II by coordinating training, planning for rearmament, supplying Great Britain with important material, and finally directing the war. Marshall influenced Congress to change the rules of promotion so that promising officers, regardless of seniority, could be promoted. Among his protégés were Dwight D. Eisenhower, H. H. Arnold, Omar Bradley, Mark Clark, and Joseph Stilwell. During World War II he developed and executed U.S. strategy. Marshall advocated the conquest of Germany through France, and his plan was finally adopted. Many of his wartime tasks were diplomatic. When he resigned as Chief of Staff, he was promptly appointed (Nov., 1945) special ambassador to China by President Truman and was later recalled (Jan., 1947) to be made Secretary of State. After engineering (Feb., 1947) immediate aid to Greece and Turkey, he fostered the European Recovery Program (called the Marshall Plan ) to promote postwar economic recovery in Europe. This plan was a great success and it laid the groundwork for a revitalized Europe and the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . He resigned because of ill health in Jan., 1949. In Sept., 1950, he was called out of retirement to become Secretary of Defense, but he resigned from this post in Sept., 1951. For the Marshall Plan he received the 1953 Nobel Peace Prize.

                                Born Catskill, N.Y. Having served in World War I, he embarked upon a career in journalism, working as an editorial writer and military critic for the Detroit News. In World War II he was chief combat historian in the Central Pacific (1943) and chief historian for the European Theater of Operations (1945) and during the Korean War was an infantry operations analyst for the U.S. army, with the rank of brigadier general. Marshall developed several systems to analyze infantry performance in battle. His conclusions about the performance of riflemen in combat have been discredited; this has cast a shadow on the validity of his work in general. Among his many works are Blitzkrieg (1940); Armies on Wheels (1941); Men against Fire (1947); The River and the Gauntlet (1953); Pork Chop Hill (1956); Sinai Victory (1958); Night Drop (1962); and Crimsoned Prairie (1972).

                                Born Robert Keith Richey, Jr., he preformed under the name Brian Keith (which reportedly was the surname of a grandparent). The gruff actor landed his first film role at age 3 and is best remembered for his role as Uncle Bill on television's Family Affair (1966-71). He also starred in Hardcastle and McCormick (1983-86) . His films include The Violent Men (1955) , Mister Roberts (1948) and The Parent Trap (1961), Young Guns (1988). During World War II he served in the Marines, winning a Navy Air Medal.

                                David Keith was born in Knoxville, TN where he currently resides and owns a cattle ranch. A graduate of the University of Tennessee, his enduring movie career began in 1979 with a small role in The Rose. Keith quickly became a specialist in portraying all-American boy roles who were cursed with a fatal character flaw or two, as witnessed in An Officer and a Gentleman (1982). Keith's performance as a suicidal officer-in-training earned him two Golden Globe nominations. Retaining his military buzz-cut from Officer, Keith had his first above-the-title starring role in 1983's The Lords of Discipline. Other films include The Great Santini (1979), Red Dawn and Firestarter (1984), Major League II (1994), The Indian in the Cupboard (1995), Behind Enemy Lines (2001), Barbershop (2002), and Daredevil (2003).
