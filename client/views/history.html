                  <h1>History</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The Dickson/Dixon (and other derivates) family name was first found in Scotland. Early records show Thomas Dicson, a follower of the Douglas clan, at the capture of Castle Douglas in 1307.</p>
                  <p>Although the name was Scottish in it's origin, with the spelling of Dicson or Dickson (the most common usage in Scotland today), being a Borders counties name it also spread to the north and midlands of England to become a popular family name with the spelling of Dixon.</p>
                  <p>It was during the 11th century that the use of surnames was introduced to the British Isles by the Normans. They were usually local (a place or landmark), patronymic ("son of"), a trade or profession name, or a nickname. The name Dixon/Dickson is a patronymic name, meaning "Dick's son" or "son of Dick". Coming from Scotland it might seem strange that it is not "MacDick", but this is simply explained again by it's Borders origins.</p>
                  <p>The ancient family motto is said to be "Fortes Fortuna Juvat", which is Latin for "Fortune Favors the Brave".</p>
                  <p>In his book, The Border and Riding Clans and a Shorter History of Clan Dixon, (published by Albany, New York, 1888) B. Homer Dixon wrote: - "In a charter from King Robert Bruce about A.D. 1306 to Thomas Dickson it [the name] occurs as Filius Ricardi (son of Richard) and the Charter is endorsed Carta Thomas fil Dick."</p>
                  <p>
                    <img src="/img/arms.gif" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-left">
                    "Nesbit in his Heraldry (Edinburgh, 1722) says 'The Dicksons are descended from one Richard Keith, said to be a son of the family of Keith's Earls Marshalls of Scotland.' and in proof thereof carry the chief of Keith Marischal. This Richard was commonly called Dick and the 'son' was styled after him. The affix of son in the Lowlands answering to the prefix Mac in the Highlands."
                  </p>
                  <p>Because of the connection to Richard Keith, the descendants of Thomas Dicson/Dickson are considered part of the Clan Keith and use their tartan.</p>
                  <p>The Chief of Clan Keith has the Latin motto "Veritas Vincit," which translates "Truth Conquers" which is also used on their clansman's badge.</p>
                  <p>In 1583, a list of Gentlemen and Surnames in the Marches of England and Scotland includes the name Dixon as Gentlemen of the East March. Many Dixons can also be found within the English East March, presumably having begun their association there when Berwick-Upon-Tweed was Scottish and it's Governor, the Keith Marischal.</p>
                  <p>Thomas Dickson himself has quite a history. He was associated in some way with William Wallace of "Braveheart", and he was killed by the English in 1307 in battle. Tradition states that he was slashed across the abdomen but continued to fight holding the abdominal wound closed with one hand until he finally dropped dead. He is buried in the churchyard of St. Bride of Douglas, and his marker shows him with a sword in one hand and holding his belly with the other.  Robert de Brus (Bruce) had made him Castellan of Castle Douglas the year before he was killed.</p>
                  <p>The Dixons (and other Borders Families) were formally recognized as a Clan by the Scottish Parliament in 1587  when the Parliament of Scotland passed a statute "For the quieting and keping in obiedince of the disorderit subiectis inhabitantis of the bordors hielands and Ilis." Attached to the statute was a Roll of the Clans, and contained both a borders portion and a highland portion. The borders part of the Roll, shows the Dixons as a clan with chiefs in the East March.  According  to the book, Traits and Stories of the Scottish People, London, 1867, the Clan Dixon was known as 'The Famous Dicksons'!</p>
                  <p>Their daughters appear to have been likewise eminent, in their case we must suppose both for beauty and accomplishments, as the old rhyme says:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                     <p>
                       Boughtrip and Belchester<br>
                       Hatchetknows and Darnchester<br>
                       Leetholm and the Peel;<br>
                       If ye dinna get a wife in ane of thae places<br>
                       Ye'll ne'er do weel.
                     </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Buhtrig, Belchester, Leitholm and the Peel were Dickson baronies. Darchester belonged at one time to the Trotters.</p>
                  <p>In 1591, two bonds were signed by the principal Barons and Gentlemen of the East Marches pledging themselves to serve the King against Bothwell, and of the forty-one subscribers whose names have been preserved four were Dicksons.</p>
                  <p>In 1603, when the crowns of Scotland and England were united under James VI of Scotland, he found it expedient to disperse the unruly Border Clans to England, northern Scotland and to Ireland.</p>
                  <p>Border clans naturally differed quite widely from Highland clans, who after all had an active existence that lasted a century and a half longer than that of the border clans, giving them extra time for development. A main point of difference was the possession by the Highland clans of Gaelic speech and a unique culture of their own until 1745. The Highlanders were also geographically much more isolated from the general course of Scottish history than were the Scottish Borderers. Both Border and Highland clans, however, had the essential feature of chiefship, and had territories in which a majority of their clansmen lived.</p>
                  <p>Border clans did practice some Gaelic customs, such as tutorship when an heir who was a minor succeeded to the chiefship, and giving bonds of manrent. Although feudalism existed, tribal loyalty was much more important, and this is what distinguished the Borderers from other lowland Scots. In fact, the same is also true of the English Borderers.</p>

                  <h1>Heraldry</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The symbols and heraldry associated with our Scottish heritage are indeed fascinating to many people. Unfortunately, they are often misunderstood and misused. The Clan Keith Society USA, Inc. encourages all interested parties to learn and follow the rules of heraldry. Primarily, that there is no such thing as a family coat of arms. Arms are the property and signature of an individual, and the ownership of arms is strictly maintained by Lord Lyon. Those eager to show their support of Clan Keith are encouraged to use the clansman's crest badge as described below.</p>
                  <h2>Understanding Heraldry</h2>
                  <img src="/img/arms-small.jpg" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-left">
                  <p>"Heraldry, or armory, is a system of personal or corporate identification that first developed in Europe during the twelfth century and which is still in use today. It uses bright colors in recognizable and easily remembered arrangements together with objects, called 'charges'.... These colorful designs were first used on banners, shields and surcoats worn or carried by individual knights in battle and in tournaments. The term 'coat of arms' derives from the surcoat on which the heraldry was displayed.</p>
                  <p>In order that heraldic symbolism would be able to identify the individual, rules evolved whereby each coat of arms could belong to only one person at a time.... In some European countries, a system of 'patronymic arms' has grown up - persons bearing a particular name, although perhaps unrelated, are considered as having an equal right to the arms of the name. This is not the case in Scotland and it is essential in understanding Scots heraldry to realize that the rule concerning the individuality of heraldry was, and is, strictly applied under Acts of the Scottish Parliament of 1592 and 1672; even an eldest son may not bear his father's arms during his father's lifetime without a suitable difference being displayed. Consequently, the terms 'family arms' or 'clan crest' are meaningless in Scotland. Arms are strictly personal to the owner and their use or display by others, without permission, is illegal.</p>
                  <p>The only heraldic device which may be used by a non-armigerous clansman is the so-called strap and buckle or clansman's crest badge."</p>

                  <h2>Keith Heraldry</h2>
                  <img src="/img/arms.gif" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-left">
                  <p>According to early accounts, a warrior of the Chatti slew the Danish General Camus at the Battle of Barrie in 1010. For his valor, Malcolm II dipped three fingers into the blood of the slain and drew them down the shield of the warrior, thereafter named Marbhachair Chamuis, or 'Camus Slayer'. Ever since then, the chief of the Keiths has born on his arms the same three (sometimes four) red lines. This is depicted as early as 1316 on the seal of Sir Robert de Keith, marischal.</p>
                  <p>The Keith crest is a roebuck's head (usually a 10-point stag) emerging out of a Crest Coronet (notifying nobility).</p>
                  <p style="clear:both;"></p>
                  <h2>Keith Standard</h2>
                  <p>The standard is a long, narrow, tapering flag, granted by the Lord Lyon only to those who have a following, such as clan chiefs. As such, it is the property of that individual and should not be used or displayed by others except by permission (such as the educational purpose here).</p>
                  <p>At the hoist, the standard usually shows the owner's arms, though some are still granted with the former practice of having the national saltire in the hoist (as the one shown here). The remainder of the flag is divided into two tracts of the livery colors for chiefs of clans or families.... Upon this background are usually displayed the owner's crest and heraldic badges, separated by traverse bands bearing the owner's motto or slogan.</p>
                  <p>The length of the standard varies according to the rank of its owner, ranging from 4 to 8 yards. As the Earl of Kintore, the Chief of the Name Keith's standard is 6 yards in length.</p>

                  <h2>Keith Mottos</h2>
                  <p>Often associated with battle cries, mottos appear in virtually all Scottish Arms. Most authorities believe that mottos first appeared on standards and shields, and were thus used as war cries as well as religious or patriotic statements. They usually appear in an escrol above the individual's crest, as well as in the clansman's badge. Clan Keith recognizes two mottos:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Quae amissa salva, which translates What has been lost is safe. This motto references the role that the Keith family played in protecting the Scottish Regalia (crown, scepter, sword and scabbard) from Oliver Cromwell's troops during 1651-2.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Veritas vincit (Truth conquers)</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>Keith Plant Badge</h2>
                  <img src="/img/White_Rose.gif" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-left">
                  <p>The Keith plant badge is the <strong>white rose</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Before tartans and clan crests were established, plant badges were the likely symbols of clan affiliation. Many Scottish clans opted for sprigs from trees like oak, Scots pine, hazel, birch, juniper, rowan and even driftwood to identify themselves. Other clans chose among Scottish wildflowers for a plant badge.</p>
                  <p>Sprigs of the plant may be pinned behind the silver crest on their bonnet or sash-badge brooch. The plant badge may also be carried beside the Clan standard or fixed on a staff or spear.</p>
                  <h2>Keith Clansman's Crest Badge</h2>
                  <img src="/img/badge.gif" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-right">
                  <p>The clansman's crest badge may be worn and displayed by the Chief's relatives, including his own immediate family and even his eldest son, and ALL members of the extended family called the "Clan", whether bearing the Clan surname or that of one of its septs ; in sum, all those who profess allegiance to that Chief and wish to demonstrate their association with the Clan.</p>
                  <p>It is correct for these to wear their Chief's Crest encircled with a strap and buckle bearing their Chief's Motto or Slogan. The strap and buckle is the sign of the clansman, and he demonstrates his membership of his Chief's Clan by wearing his Chief's Crest within it.</p>

                  <h1>The Keith &amp; Austin Tartan</h1>
                  <img src="/img/piper.jpg" alt="" class="margin-right-10 img-thumbnail pull-right">
                  <p class="initial-capital">There is no clearer symbol of Scottish identity than tartan, especially when worn in the form of a kilt. However, the origin and significance of the tartan in Scottish history is unclear.</p>
                  <p>Tartan is a particular weave of woolen cloth that is often associated with the modern use of the word plaid. Plaid patterns may include squares and rectangles woven in unique patterns, while tartan is made up only of squares.</p>
                  <p>Tartan is always woven as twill (two threads passing over two, then under two). A number of colored stripes of varying width are woven from the edge of the cloth, running its full length. The basic sequence of stripes (the sett) is then reversed around a number of pivot points so that the stripes continually repeat and reverse across the width of the cloth. The woven sequence is known as the warp. The same sequence of stripes, the weft, is then interwoven at right angles to the warp to create the finished tartan. It is the sett, therefore, that distinguishes one tartan from another.</p>

                  <h2>The Significance of Tartan</h2>
                  <p>The underlying significance of the tartan today is as a means of clan or family allegiance, but just when and how this became a part of Scottish culture is hotly debated. The Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland illustrates this confusion by sharing various perspectives on the matter:</p>
                  <blockquote><p>There are still some who would claim that, right back into the mists of time, each of the clans and families was immediately recognisable by the pattern or sett of the tartan that wore it. The idea is attractively romantic, but the evidence for it is extremely slight and it rests on one or two isolated and far from conclusive examples. While there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Highlanders wore tartan, there is very little which fits with the idea that a widespread system of recognition existed before the early 1800s (928).</p></blockquote>
                  <p>One factor that has been decisive about the history of the development of the modern system of identification has been the influence of the tartan manufacturer. They were responsible for developing early catalogs and order books. It was soon accepted that the authority for stating what was the correct tartan for a clan must be its chief. In 1815, the Highland Society of London began its collection of approved tartans; and the first book on clan tartans appeared in 1831.</p>
                  <p>Identifiable tartans have grown, as the Scottish Clan and Family Encyclopedia states, "from a trickle to a flood. Many clans have more than one tartan; there are a host of names who are distinguished by a tartan of their own although they have never constituted a clan; and against a list of around one hundred recognized clan chiefs today, records of some two thousand named tartans exist, of which a number represent public bodies or commemorate specific events (39)."</p>
                  <h2>Different Types of Tartan</h2>
                  <p>In addition to normal clan tartan, in some cases a clan may also have 'Hunting' or 'Dress' setts adapted for their particular activity (hunting more muted and dress more fancy).</p>
                  <p>Other tartans may be described as "Ancient", "Modern", "Reproduction", "Weathered" and "Muted". The first three of these have nothing to do with the antiquity of the pattern, but with the dyes employed.</p>
                  <h2>The Keith and Austin Tartans</h2>
                  <p>The proper name for Clan Keith's tartan is "Keith and Austin". While Austins were a sept of Clan Keith, it is unclear as to how their surname became a part of the official tartan name. Either way, the Chief of Clan Keith recognizes both an Ancient and Modern version of the sett (shown below). Today's Clan Keith members may wear either, but the ancient is much more common - in part because the darker dyes used with the modern tartan make it difficult to distinguish from the famous Black Watch tartan.</p>

                  <h1>Highland Dress</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The evolution of Highland dress owes much to the military. After the Proscription, civilian dress began to reflect that of the military. Many of the characteristic features of today's dress have a military origin, such as the shoulder straps on today's jackets and the buttons on the sleeve.</p>
                  <p class="clearfix">
                    <img src="/img/coat.jpg" alt="" class="pull-left margin-right-10 img-thumbnail">
                    The cuts of various forms of evening jacket can also be traced back to the late 1700s, including the "Prince Charlie" (shown left) and Argyle.
                  </p>
                  <p>Toward the end of the eighteenth century, the great kilt gave way to today's "little kilt". Early kilts were usually made of less material, for economic reasons, and were worn much higher up the leg. Today, it is considered proper for the kilt to fall to the top of the wearer's knee (although many wear it improperly longer).</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Sporrans</strong> started out as utilitarian leather pouches hung about the waist and drawn together with strings. The more decorative 'sporan molach', or hair sporran, appeared toward the end of the eighteenth century. Today sporran's are primarily decorative, with more casual leather available for day-wear and more formal hair sporrans for evening-wear.

                  <p><strong>Waistcoats</strong> have become less common, giving way to waist belts worn with a large brass or silver buckle. Belts are considered optional wear.</p>

                    <strong>Hose</strong> were originally made of cloth, and usually patterned with a red and white 'war pattern'. They were later replace by knitted woollen hose. Today's white hose are of modern origin, originating in the 1960s as a substitute to the diced or tartan hose for evening wear.

                    <strong>Dirks</strong> were originally worn as personal weapons. Today they are worn in great variety, both day and night, but 'proper' wear is 'for evening full-dress occasions'. The 'sgian dubh', worn in the hosetop, became general wear only in the nineteenth century.

                    The round knitted <strong>bonnet</strong>, originally worn flat, towards the end of the eighteenth century was cocked up vertically and then decorated by ostrich plumes. This eventually became the military feather bonnet, and by creasing the unadorned bonnet from front-to-rear, became the Glengarry bonnet (shown left). Bonnets as a part of Highland dress are also worn less frequently today.

                    <p>Although the story by which the tartan kilt has become the national dress of Scotland is tortuous and myth-laden, and the way in which it is worn can vary from the sublime to the ridiculous, Highland dress is a powerful symbol of the wearer's pride in a Scottish ancestry and in Scotland itself. There are few, if any, other forms of national dress which can claim to make such a clear and unequivocal statement, and to be so instantly and widely recognisable (42).</p>

                  <h2>Dressing for the Occasion</h2>
                  <p>Many members of Clan Keith choose to show their Scottish and clan pride by wearing the tartan and/or Highland dress. This dress is not required and can be quite expensive, but should you choose to become actively involved in Scottish and clan events you will probably choose to follow this practice. Our society is dedicated to observing and respecting our heritage, and thus we encourage individuals to properly wear the tartan and/or Highland dress. One of the best instructional guides is <i>So You're Going to Wear the Kilt? by J. Charles Thompson</i> (published by Heraldic Art, Arlington, VA).</p>

                  <h3>Women</h3>
                  <p>The guidelines for women's attire are much less defined than those of men. Two popular options are wearing a tartan sash and clansman's badge with normal attire (whatever the occasion), and kilted skirts in the clan tartan. Keith t-shirts and golf shirts are also available for more casual occasions.</p>
                  <p>Special guidelines to keep in mind according to <i>So You're Going to Wear the Kilt?</i> by J. Charles Thompson:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>Women wearing the sash should pin it to their right shoulder. There are only three exceptions where pinning the sash on the left shoulder is appropriate;</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>ladies who are chiefs</li>
                      <li>ladies who are married to a chief</li>
                      <li>ladies who are married to colonels of Highland regiments</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>"No lady is going to wear the kilt". Female dancers and pipe band members, however, do wear kilts. Thompson's point is that the kilt is not anatomically designed for women, and women should therefore wear skirts, kilted or other.</p>

                  <h1>Origins of Clan Keith</h1>
                  <p class="initial-capital">The Keiths traced their origins back to an ancient Rhineland tribe called the Catti. Sometime in the first century BC, so the legend goes, the Catti fought the Romans in the Hercynian forest: their retreat took them by Katwyck on the Rhine to embark for Scotland from the coast of Holland. Just how many Catti took to the boats in the exodus is not known but they eventually made landfall in Caithness or -a as it was perhaps more recognizably known in first-century Scotland - Cattiness.</p>
                  <p>From the time they landed the Catti began to multiply significantly and adopted the local ways by joining the clan system as Clan Chattan. The clan spread throughout the north of Scotland and , as with all success stories of their time, what the Catti couldn't win with the sword they won by marriage. Most of all they seemed to have had a sixth sense when it came to making a decision about which side to support in the wars and power struggles of the coming centuries. By this time the family name had changed to Keth or Keith.</p>

                    </figure>
                    History tells us that the first Keith to draw a sword for his sovereign and profit by it was Robert Keith: he slew Cammus, a Danish invader, in single combat at the Battle of Barras in Angus in 1010. Rewards quickly followed with the grant of lands in East Lothian and Robert's appointment as hereditary Grand Marischal of Scotland. With his title came a motto <strong>VERITAS VINCIT</strong> or 'truth conquers' and a coat of arms. Concerning the origins of the heraldic device, the story goes that when the Battle of Barras was over, the King (Malcolm II) came to look at the dead body of Cammus the Dance and, pleased with what he saw, bent down and dipped his fingers in the Dane's still-warm blood to make three strokes, or pales, on Keith's shield. Yet another version tells that a noble combatant disputed the Keith claim of having killed Cammus and was then himself challenged to single combat over this point of honour. This dispute was resolved when Keith killed the nobleman and it was this noble's blood which decorated Keiths shield - this is perhaps a better and more satisfying explanation of the motto and coat of arms. Robert Keith went on to marry Margaret Fraser of Tweeddale and founded the Keith family. - <i>from Sam Coull's Nothing But My Sword, p. 7-8.</i>
                  </p>
                  <p>These early accounts, however, remain disputed by some as "absurd fictions" (see <i>Clan Keith</i> by Alan McNie, 1986; <i>The Great Historic Families of Scotland</i> by James Taylor, 1887). "All that is known with certainty on the subject is, that in the reign of David I, when Norman, Saxon, Flemish and Scandinavian settlers in great numbers took up their residence in Scotland, a part of the district of Keith, in East Lothian, was possessed by a baron named Herveius, who witnessed the charter by which King David granted Annandale to Robert de Brus. His estate received from him the designation of Keith Hervei, and afterwards of Keith Marischal." - <i>Clan Keith</i> by Alan McNie, 1986</p>
                  <p>His son, Herveius de Keith, held the office of King's Marischal under Malcolm IV and William I. The family soon became numerous and powerful, and spread their branches far and wide throughout the Lowland districts of Scotland.</p>
